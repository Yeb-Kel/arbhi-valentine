<h1>Arbhi, My Queen ❤️</h1>

<p>
Before you came into my life, I never knew love could feel this safe and this beautiful.<br>
I've always hoped our bond can be special and yes you made it true for me.<br>
<br>
Your smile is my favorite sight.<br> 
Your voice is my favorite sound.<br>
Your happiness means everything to me.<br>
We have ups and downs sometimes yet, you never lose it.<br>
This is to tell you how sweet you are, Sweedie.<br>
<br>
If I had to choose again,<br>
I would still choose you — every single time.<br>
Your smile is always my medicine, the light that gives me sight to see your heart...<br>
<br>
I love and cherish you Mi Reina,<br>
Happy Valentine’s Day ❤️<br>
